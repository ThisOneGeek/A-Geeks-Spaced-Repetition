# A Geek's Spaced Repetition
## Description:
Simple Spaced Repetition Program that could be designed to my own vision. 

## Features:
- Doubles time in between each card viewing.
- Failure returns the card to the lowest level.
- Cards are automatically searched.
- Cards can be "flipped".
- Two options for each card: Know and Don't Know.
- Cards can be added, and will be automatically updated in the in the card reviewer.
- Tracks cards succeeded, failed, and otherwise remaining.

## To-Do (to get to at some point):
- Better graphics/images.
- Full card list viewing.
- Feedback on card added (and reset of text boxes).
- Create excel file on startup if none found.

## Additional information:
- Requires _DePixelHalbfett.ttf_ from font [*DePixel*](https://www.dafont.com/depixel.font)
- To create a _Repetition.xlsx_ file, run _Repetition.py_ as main for the time being.
